## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Prepare your input file**
   - Place your CSV file with Clutch.co profile URLs in the `data` directory
   - Ensure the file has a column containing the profile URLs
   - The script will automatically detect URL columns

2. **Run the scraper**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **View results**
   - The script will create a `clutch_with_sites.csv` file with the results
   - Progress is saved automatically, so you can stop and resume anytime

## 🛠 Scripts

- `app.py`: Main scraping script
- `continue_scraping.py`: Resume interrupted scraping sessions
- `merge_csv.py`: Merge multiple CSV files
- `single_url.py`: Test scraping for a single URL
- `update_missing_urls.py`: Update missing URLs in the dataset

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the configuration section in `app.py` to customize:

```python
# Input/Output files
INPUT_CSV = "data/extracted_urls_20250604_161856.csv"  # Your input file
OUTPUT_CSV = "clutch_with_sites.csv"  # Output file
TEMP_CSV = "clutch_temp.csv"  # Temporary progress file

# Browser settings
HEADLESS = True  # Set to False to see the browser
WAIT_SHORT = 20  # Seconds to wait for elements
MAX_RETRIES = 2  # Number of retries for failed attempts
SLEEP_BETWEEN = (3, 6)  # Random delay between requests (min, max) seconds
```
